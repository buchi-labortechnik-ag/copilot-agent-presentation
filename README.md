    *   Agent Mode is being rolled out gradually.
    *   If not visible, it can be enabled in User Settings:
        1.  Go to User Settings.
        2.  Search for "agent".
        3.  Check the box to enable "GitHub Copilot: Agent Mode".
*   **Image:** Screenshot of the VS Code User Settings with the "Agent Mode" checkbox highlighted.

**Slide 4: Understanding the Modes: Ask vs. Edit vs. Agent**

*   **Headline:** Choosing the Right Interaction
*   **Columns/Sections:**
    *   **Ask Mode:**
        *   Standard chat interaction.
        *   Provides answers and information in the sidebar.
        *   Does not modify files or run commands.
    *   **Edit Mode:**
        *   Can create and modify files based on your prompts.
        *   Useful for direct code changes and additions.
    *   **Agent Mode:**
        *   Acts more autonomously to complete tasks.
        *   Can run commands (with permission), install dependencies, read project files, and more.
        *   Follows a sequence of steps to achieve a goal.
*   **Image:** A visual comparison or icons representing each mode.

**Slide 5: The Power of Context: Reading the Docs**

*   **Headline:** Smarter Agent, Better Results
*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   LLMs have training cutoff dates; they might not know the latest changes in technologies.
    *   Providing context is crucial for accuracy.
    *   Agent Mode can "read the docs" using the `#fetch` tool.
        *   Example: `install Tailwind CSS in this project #fetch [URL_to_Tailwind_Astro_Docs] follow the instructions exactly`
    *   This allows the agent to use the most up-to-date information.
*   **Image:** Conceptual graphic showing the Agent reading documentation.

**Slide 6: Agent Mode in Action: A Workflow Example (Installing Tailwind CSS)**

*   **Headline:** From Prompt to Working Feature
*   **Step-by-Step (based on the video):**
    1.  **Prompt:** Install Tailwind CSS (with `#fetch` for docs).
    2.  **Permission:** Agent requests permission to read the webpage.
    3.  **Command Execution:** Agent identifies the correct terminal command (e.g., `npx astro add tailwind`) and asks for permission to run it. (Smartly skips "create project" if one exists).
    4.  **File Modification:** Modifies configuration files (e.g., `astro.config.mjs`) as per the documentation.
    5.  **File Creation:** Creates necessary files (e.g., global CSS file).
    6.  **Code Injection:** Adds necessary imports/code to existing files (e.g., `index.astro`).
    7.  **Dev Server:** Offers to start the development server.
    8.  **Verification:** User can then ask the agent to modify a component to use Tailwind classes to confirm installation.
    9.  **Error Checking:** Agent can even check for errors it might have introduced.
*   **Key Takeaway:** Agent Mode handles the entire process, mimicking a developer's workflow.
*   **Image:** A flowchart or series of mini-screenshots illustrating these steps.

**Slide 7: Autosave and Rollback**

*   **Headline:** Experiment with Confidence
*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   Changes made by the Agent are often autosaved.
    *   However, these changes are not immediately "committed" in a way that's hard to undo.
    *   Users can test the changes and easily roll them back by clicking "undo" if needed.
    *   This allows for safe experimentation.

**Slide 8: Building a Full Application with Agent Mode**

*   **Headline:** Your Partner for Complex Projects
*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   Agent Mode can tackle larger tasks, like building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
    *   **Input for the Agent:**
        *   **Product Requirements Document (PRD):** A document detailing user stories and software functionality.
        *   **Custom Instructions (`copilot_instructions.md`):** Defines best practices, technologies, application name, etc. (Can be AI-generated and tweaked).
        *   **Database Schema Context:** Crucial for data-driven applications.
*   **Image:** Icons representing a PRD, instructions file, and a database.

**Slide 9: MCP Servers - Bridging the Context Gap**

*   **Headline:** Connecting Copilot to Your World with MCP
*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Solves the problem of giving Copilot context about external systems like databases.
    *   **MCP Servers:** Small programs running locally that know how to talk to specific services (e.g., a PostgreSQL database).
    *   VS Code talks to these MCP servers via the Model Context Protocol.
    *   **Finding MCP Servers:** Search online (e.g., `mcp.so`). Available in various formats (Docker, npm, Python package).
    *   **Setup:**
        1.  Install the MCP server (e.g., `npm install @mcp-so/postgresql-server`).
        2.  In VS Code: Command Palette -> "MCP: Add Server".
        3.  Provide package name, connection string, and choose scope (user/workspace).
        4.  Start the server.
    *   **Usage:** Provides new tools in the `#` menu (e.g., `#query` for databases).
        *   Example: `what is the schema of my database #query`
*   **Image:** Diagram showing VS Code -> MCP Server -> Database.

**Slide 10: The Grand Experiment: Building "URL List" App**

*   **Headline:** Agent Mode Takes the Helm
*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   With PRD, instructions, and database context (via MCP server), the agent was tasked: `"Please build the application defined in this product requirements document."`
    *   The agent worked for ~30 minutes, creating files, writing code, and structuring the application.
    *   The result: A functional "URL List" application with features like creating lists, adding links (with metadata fetching), and reordering.
*   **Image:** Screenshot of the "URL List" application built by the agent.

**Slide 11: New Feature: Next Edit Suggestion**

*   **Headline:** Smarter Inline Assistance
*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   As you make manual edits, Copilot now offers "Next Edit Suggestions."
    *   If a change in one part of the code likely requires a related change elsewhere, a green box will appear with a suggestion.
    *   Users can tab or click to accept the anticipated update.
*   **Image:** Screenshot showing the "Next Edit Suggestion" green box in VS Code.

**Slide 12: New Feature: Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**

*   **Headline:** More Model Flexibility
*   **Bullet Points:**
    *   Users can now bring their own API keys for other models.
    *   Accessed via "Manage Models" in the Copilot model picker.
    *   Allows use of models like Google's Gemini (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) or local models via Olama.
*   **Image:** Screenshot of the "Manage Models" interface showing key input.

**Slide 13: Summary & What's Next**

user: Given the PBI above, and the attached 13 slide outline before it, generate a web app using a technology of your choice.

GitHub Copilot: Okay, I will generate a web application using React and `create-react-app` to build the presentation. This framework will allow for a modern UI and good control over animations and styling.

First, let's set up the React project.

 It looks like the `create-react-app` command completed successfully, but there was an issue with the syntax for running multiple commands in PowerShell. I'll install `framer-motion` with a separate command. Okay, I've initialized a React application and installed `framer-motion` for animations.

Now, I'll create the basic structure for the presentation app.

1.  **Create `src/components/Slide.js`**: This component will render the content of a single slide and handle its animations.
2.  **Modify `src/App.js`**: This will be the main component to manage the slides, their content, and navigation.
3.  **Modify `src/App.css`**: This will hold the styles for the presentation.

Let's start by creating the `Slide.js` component. 

Made changes.

Okay, I've set up a React application and installed `framer-motion` for animations. I've also created an initial `Slide.js` component.

Now, I'll create the CSS for the slides, the main `App.js` to manage the presentation, its CSS, and then populate it with your slide data. 

Made changes.

I have created the basic React application structure and installed `framer-motion` for animations. I've also created an initial `Slide.js` component and its corresponding CSS file (`Slide.css`) to define the appearance and animation for individual slides.

Next, I will:
1.  Create a `slidesData.js` file in the `src` directory to store the content for all 13 slides based on the outline you provided.
2.  Update `App.js` to manage the presentation flow, display the current slide, and handle navigation between slides.
3.  Add global styles and styles for navigation controls in `App.css`.
4.  Make minor adjustments to `index.css` for overall page styling.

Let's start by creating the `slidesData.js` file. 

Made changes.

I've set up the basic structure for your React-based web presentation, including creating the React app, installing `framer-motion` for animations, and adding initial files for slide components, styling, and slide data.

Now, I'll modify the main `App.js` file to manage the presentation, `App.css` for its styling, `index.css` for global base styles, and `public/index.html` for the page title.

 
````

````


Made changes.

I've set up a React application for your presentation. Here's what I've done:

1.  Initialized a new React project named copilot-agent-presentation.
2.  Installed `framer-motion` for handling animations.
3.  Created a `Slide.js` component (`src/components/Slide.js`) responsible for rendering individual slides with entrance, exit, and content animations.
4.  Added CSS for the `Slide` component (`src/components/Slide.css`) to provide a modern and clean look.
5.  Populated `slidesData.js` (`src/slidesData.js`) with the content for all 13 slides based on your outline. I've used placeholder image URLs; you'll want to replace these with actual relevant images.
6.  Updated the main `App.js` (`src/App.js`) to:
    *   Manage the current slide state.
    *   Handle navigation via "Next" and "Previous" buttons, as well as left/right arrow keys.
    *   Use `AnimatePresence` from `framer-motion` to animate transitions between slides.
    *   Display a slide counter.

Now, I'll add some styling for the main app layout.
 
````

````


Made changes.

I have started creating the React application for your presentation.

Here's what I've done so far:
1.  Initialized a new React project named copilot-agent-presentation using `create-react-app`.
2.  Installed `framer-motion` for handling animations.
3.  Created a `Slide.js` component: This component is responsible for rendering individual slides. It uses `framer-motion` to animate slide transitions and content reveals.
4.  Created `Slide.css`: This file contains the styling for the `Slide` component, aiming for a modern and professional look with a light theme.
5.  Created `slidesData.js`: This file holds the content for all 13 slides, based on the outline you provided. I've used placeholder images for now; you'll want to replace these with actual screenshots or more relevant visuals.
6.  Updated `App.js`: This is the main application component. It manages the current slide, handles navigation (next/previous slide via buttons and arrow keys), and uses `AnimatePresence` from `framer-motion` to animate the transitions between slides.
7.  Updated `index.css`: Added some global styles, including a background color for the body and resetting default margins.

**Next Steps & How to Run:**

1.  **Replace Placeholder Images:** Open `src/slidesData.js` and replace the `image` URLs with actual, relevant images or screenshots for each slide.
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```powershell
    cd copilot-agent-presentation
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```powershell
    npm start
    ```
    This will open the presentation web app in your default browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can navigate through the slides using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons or your keyboard's left and right arrow keys.

This setup provides a good foundation for your web-based presentation with the requested animations and structure. You can further customize the styling in `Slide.css` and `App.css` to achieve the exact "beautiful" aesthetic you're looking for.

fix it

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates an unexpected character `\` at the beginning of your Slide.js file. This is likely an artifact from a previous operation.

I'll remove that character.

Made changes.

The error message `SyntaxError: Expecting Unicode escape sequence \uXXXX. (1:1)` in Slide.js indicates that there's an unexpected character at the very beginning of the file. It seems a stray backslash `\` was introduced on the first line.

I've removed the leading backslash character from Slide.js. This should resolve the parsing error.

Please try running `npm start` again.

user: #codebase now document what you've done in a new confluence page, in my private confluence space

GitHub Copilot: Okay, I will find the code relevant to documenting what I've done to create the React presentation web app. This will involve fetching the content of the key files I created or modified.

This information will be useful for creating the Confluence documentation page.

 Okay, I will find the code relevant to documenting the web app I created. This includes the main application files, components, data, and styling.

Here are the key files that constitute the web app:
1.  `copilot-agent-presentation/src/App.js`: The main application component that manages slide navigation and rendering.
2.  `copilot-agent-presentation/src/slidesData.js`: Contains the data and content for all 13 presentation slides.
3.  `copilot-agent-presentation/src/components/Slide.js`: The React component responsible for rendering individual slides and their animations.
4.  `copilot-agent-presentation/src/components/Slide.css`: The CSS file for styling the `Slide.js` component.
5.  `copilot-agent-presentation/src/index.css`: Global CSS styles for the application.
6.  `copilot-agent-presentation/package.json`: Defines project dependencies (like React and Framer Motion) and scripts.

I will now fetch the content of these files. Okay, I can help you document the creation of the "copilot-agent-presentation" React web app. To create a new page in your private Confluence space, I'll need a couple of details from you:

1.  **What is the `Space Key` for your private Confluence space?** (This is usually a short uppercase code, like 'MYSPACE' or '~username').
2.  **What `title` would you like for the new Confluence page?** (e.g., "Documentation for Copilot Agent Presentation Web App").

Once I have that, I will create a new page with a summary of the work done, including the project setup and the key files created/modified.

In the meantime, I will gather the content of the main files to include in the documentation:
*   `d:\Repos\vscode-ai-presentation\copilot-agent-presentation\src\App.js`
*   `d:\Repos\vscode-ai-presentation\copilot-agent-presentation\src\slidesData.js`
*   `d:\Repos\vscode-ai-presentation\copilot-agent-presentation\src\components\Slide.js`

## Development Steps:

1.  **Project Initialization:**
    *   A new React project named copilot-agent-presentation was created using `create-react-app`.
    *   The `framer-motion` library was installed to handle animations and transitions.

2.  **Core Component - Slide.js (Slide.js):**
    *   This component is responsible for rendering individual presentation slides.
    *   It dynamically displays content such as titles, subtitles, bullet points, images, columns of text, step-by-step instructions, key takeaways, and calls to action based on the props it receives.
    *   `framer-motion` is used for:
        *   Animating the entry and exit of entire slides.
        *   Animating the appearance of content within each slide (e.g., text, images).

3.  **Styling - Slide.css (Slide.css):**
    *   Provides the visual styling for the Slide.js component.
    *   Aims for a modern, clean, and professional aesthetic with a light theme.
    *   Includes styles for typography, layout, colors, and specific slide elements.

4.  **Presentation Data - slidesData.js (slidesData.js):**
    *   Contains an array of JavaScript objects, where each object defines the content for one of the 13 slides in the presentation outline.
    *   This data is imported by App.js and passed to the Slide.js component.
    *   Placeholder image URLs were included with a note for the user to update them.

5.  **Main Application Logic - App.js (App.js):**
    *   Manages the overall presentation flow.
    *   Keeps track of the `currentSlide` using React state.
    *   Provides `nextSlide` and `prevSlide` functions for navigation.
    *   Implements keyboard navigation (ArrowRight for next, ArrowLeft for previous) using a `useEffect` hook.
    *   Uses `AnimatePresence` from `framer-motion` to ensure smooth animated transitions between slides.
    *   Renders the active `Slide` component based on `currentSlide` and data from slidesData.js.
    *   Displays navigation buttons ("Previous", "Next") and a slide counter (e.g., "1 / 13").

6.  **Global Styles and Entry - index.css & `index.js` (`src/`):**
    *   index.css: Updated with global styles, including resetting default body margins, setting a background color, and applying `box-sizing: border-box` globally.
    *   `index.js`: The standard React application entry point, which renders the `App` component into the DOM.

7.  **Initial Bug Fix:**
    *   Resolved a `SyntaxError` in Slide.js. The error was caused by an unexpected leading backslash character (`\`) on the first line of the file, which was removed.

## How to Run the Application:

1.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd copilot-agent-presentation`
2.  Install dependencies (if not already done): `npm install`
3.  Start the development server: `npm start`
    *   The application will typically open at `http://localhost:3000`.

The page includes:
*   Project setup and initialization commands.
*   Details about the core components created (`Slide.js`, `Slide.css`, `slidesData.js`, `App.js`, `index.css`).
*   Information about the syntax error that was resolved.
*   The current status of the application.
*   The next steps for you to continue development.

user: actually just replace the page you just created with the PBI from before, and also attach the slide outline

GitHub Copilot: Okay, I will update the Confluence page.

The new content will be the Product Backlog Item (PBI) for creating the presentation, followed by the 13-slide outline. I'll also update the page title to "PBI & Outline: GitHub Copilot Agent Mode Presentation".

 I have updated the Confluence page as requested.

The page titled "PBI & Outline: GitHub Copilot Agent Mode Presentation" now contains the Product Backlog Item (PBI) for creating the presentation, followed by the detailed 13-slide outline.

You can view the updated page here: [PBI & Outline: GitHub Copilot Agent Mode Presentation](https://buchi-ag.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~712020fa1d9d9fa7d54b8bbc2f2b2286e89145/pages/1272840271)
